### Some Tips:-

  - Run the **"Mdtest - Start (V4)"** Task in the **"Receive Messages"** Project to start mdtest.

    All done. While mdtest is running, you can use the **"Send Messages"** Project to send rows and rows of messages to single contacts/groups.

  - You can now easily scan the QR Code on devices connected to the same Wi-Fi/Hotspot network.

If the main device and secondary devices are connected to the same network via Wi-Fi, an option to open the QR Code as a temporary-lived webpage will appear.

This webpage is local/private to your devices in the same network only and is alive only for the duration of scanning.

This option appears when -

- Main device and secondary device are connected to the same WiFi

- Main device is connected to the Hotspot of the secondary device, etc.

Like this, it makes scanning the QR Code much easier.
